## ⚠️ Anti-Cheat Notice

> **PhysInput creates a virtual gamepad device.** Some anti-cheat software (Easy Anti-Cheat, BattlEye, Vanguard, etc.) may detect and block virtual input devices.

**This tool is designed for:**
- ✅ **Accessibility** — Alternative input for users with motor disabilities
- ✅ **Single-player games** — Full analog control with keyboard
- ✅ **Emulators** — Native analog stick support
- ✅ **Non-competitive multiplayer** — Casual online games

**Use at your own discretion in competitive online games.** We do not condone cheating.

---

## The Problem

Keyboard keys are **binary** — pressed or not pressed. This creates jerky, all-or-nothing movement that feels unnatural in games designed for analog sticks.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/comparison.gif" alt="Binary vs Analog comparison" width="600">
</p>

| Keyboard Input | → | PhysInput Output |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `█░░░░░░░█` | | `▁▂▃▅▆█▆▅▃▂▁` |
| Binary: 0% or 100% | | Smooth: 0% to 100% |

**PhysInput bridges this gap** by running your keyboard input through physics simulations, creating natural acceleration, momentum, and deceleration — just like a real analog stick.

## Installation

### 🐧 Linux

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, evdev, PyQt6

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install evdev PyQt6 --break-system-packages

# Add user to input group (required for device access)
sudo usermod -aG input $USER

# ⚠️ Log out and back in for group changes to take effect

# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/physinput/physinput.git
cd physinput/linux
pip install -e . --break-system-packages

# Run
physinput
```

<details>
<summary>📋 Troubleshooting Linux</summary>

**"Permission denied" errors:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the input group
groups | grep input

# If not, add yourself and re-login
sudo usermod -aG input $USER
```

**No devices found:**
```bash
# Check available input devices
ls -la /dev/input/

# Verify evdev can see them
python3 -c "from evdev import list_devices; print(list_devices())"
```

</details>

---

### 🪟 Windows

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, ViGEmBus driver, pynput, vgamepad, PyQt6

#### Step 1: Install ViGEmBus Driver

Download and install from: **[ViGEmBus Releases](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases)**

> This kernel driver enables virtual Xbox 360 and DualShock 4 controllers.

#### Step 2: Install PhysInput

```powershell
# Install dependencies
pip install pynput vgamepad PyQt6

# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/physinput/physinput.git
cd physinput\windows
pip install -e .

# Run
physinput
```

<details>
<summary>📋 Troubleshooting Windows</summary>

**"ViGEmBus not found" errors:**
1. Download `ViGEmBus_Setup_x64.msi` from releases
2. Run installer as Administrator
3. Restart your computer
4. Try again

**Gamepad not detected in games:**
- Start PhysInput **before** launching the game
- Some games only detect controllers at startup
- Try switching between Xbox 360 and DS4 modes

</details>

---

### 🔍 Verify Installation

```bash
# Check system requirements
physinput --check
```

This will verify all dependencies and permissions are correctly configured.

## Physics Models

PhysInput includes 9 physics models, each creating a different feel:

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Spring** | Hooke's law spring-damper system. Responsive with natural bounce. | Most games (default) |
| **Critical** | Critically damped — fastest response without overshoot. | Precision, competitive |
| **Smooth Damp** | Unity-style smooth interpolation. Butter-smooth movement. | Camera control, casual |
| **Newtonian** | F=ma physics with friction. Momentum-based movement. | Vehicles, racing |
| **Momentum** | Heavy inertial feel with thrust and drag. | Spaceships, tanks |
| **Fluid** | Viscous fluid dynamics. Like moving through water. | Underwater, relaxed |
| **PID** | Proportional-integral-derivative controller. Technical precision. | Fine-tuning enthusiasts |
| **Adaptive PID** | PID with error-dependent gain scaling. | Variable conditions |
| **Exponential** | Simple exponential smoothing. Lightweight. | Low-spec systems |

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/physics-comparison.gif" alt="Physics Model Comparison" width="600">
</p>

### Tuning Parameters

Each model has adjustable parameters:

- **Stiffness** — How quickly the stick responds (higher = snappier)
- **Damping** — How much oscillation is suppressed (higher = less bounce)
- **Mass** — Inertial resistance (higher = heavier feel)
- **Return Time** — How fast the stick returns to center

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Will this get me banned in online games?</strong></summary>

Possibly. PhysInput creates a virtual device that some anti-cheat systems detect. Use at your own risk in competitive games. We recommend single-player and accessibility use cases.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why not just use Steam Input?</strong></summary>

Steam Input is great but only works with Steam games. PhysInput works system-wide with any game, emulator, or application that supports gamepads. Additionally, Steam Input does not support physics-based keyboard to controller conversion.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this for accessibility?</strong></summary>

Yes! PhysInput was designed with accessibility in mind. It allows users who can only use keyboard/mouse to play games that require analogue input. The physics smoothing also helps users with tremors or limited fine motor control.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this add input lag?</strong></summary>

Minimal. At 120 FPS (default), the physics processing adds ~8ms of latency. You can increase the target FPS for even lower latency at the cost of slightly higher CPU usage.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use a different keyboard layout?</strong></summary>

Yes! All keys are fully rebindable. AZERTY, Dvorak, or any custom layout works fine.
